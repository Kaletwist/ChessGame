## Why did I make this project?
I took a university course where half the semester was in Rust, I could not stand rust.
I built this project to see if I could change my mind on it. 

It turns out I couldn't I ended up rushing through the project writing ugly code and not even completing it. 

I dont know if this was because I stubbornly refused to use any libraries other than one to create a window but I didn't end up even completing the project as I got sick of writing rust code.

Maybe one day I will come back and clean up this code

But for now jumping through loopholes to achieve memory safety while maintaining performance is rather unappealing, for fast code I think I am going to stick to C/C++ and to achieve memory safety I think I will use any other memory safe language.
